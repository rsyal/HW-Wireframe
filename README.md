In this assignment, I built a web design skeleton using HTML/CSS.

1. HTML sections inluded the following:
   * Header
   * Nav
   * Aside (With a Heading)
   * Section (With a Heading)
   * Article (With a Heading) contained within the Section
   * Headers contained within the Article
   * Paragraph contained within the Article 
2. CSS including styles for the following:
   * Body
   * Header, nav, and footer
   * Section
   * Aside
   * Article
   * Text elements: h1, p, etc.
3. The colors are
   * `#777`
   * `#ebebeb`
4. The widths of each section should be:
   * body: 960px
   * section: 495px
5. The fonts are:
   * font-family: 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;
   * font-size: 18px

Challenges included:
   * No prior knowledge of HTML/CSS, I'm a newbie
   * Trying to understand margin versus padding
   * Learning what to put inside the containers, still learning layout of the page
   * Understanding ID versus class
   * Learning floats, clear, overflow concepts
   * Still learning absolute, relative, fixed positioning
